## Before/After Comparison
Show the improvement through examples:

### Before Refactoring
```python
# Example of code before refactoring
def old_complex_function():
    # Complex, hard-to-understand logic
    pass
```

### After Refactoring
```python
# Example of improved code after refactoring
def clear_function_name():
    # Clean, readable logic
    pass
```
