# Timeout Error Fix Applied ✅

## 🎯 Issue Resolved
**Error**: `HTTPSConnectionPool(host='api.corpus.swecha.org', port=443): Read timed out. (read timeout=10)`

**Root Cause**: Some API calls still had 10-15 second timeouts, which were too short for the Swecha API responses.

## 🔧 Fix Applied

### Updated Timeout Configurations
All API calls in `src/utils/swecha_storage.py` now have appropriate timeouts:

| API Call | Previous Timeout | New Timeout | Line |
|----------|------------------|-------------|------|
| Authentication (`/auth/me`) | 10s | **30s** | 511 |
| User contributions | 30s | 30s ✅ | 569, 585 |
| Media contributions | 30s | 30s ✅ | 629, 645 |
| Statistics generation | 45s | 45s ✅ | 681 |
| Task status checks | 15s | **30s** | 698 |

### 📊 Complete Timeout Summary
- **✅ All API calls now have 30+ second timeouts**
- **✅ Statistics generation has 45 seconds (most demanding operation)**
- **✅ Retry strategy with exponential backoff already implemented**
- **✅ Proper error handling for timeouts**

## 🚀 Expected Results
